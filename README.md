# 21cmFirstCLASS
This is an extension of the popular 21cmFAST code that interfaces with CLASS to generate initial conditions at recombination that are consistent with the input cosmological model. These initial conditions can be set during the time of recombination, allowing one to compute the 21cm signal (and its spatial fluctuations) throughout the dark ages, as well as in the proceeding cosmic dawn and reionization epochs, just like in the standard 21cmFAST.

Comprehensive jupyter notebook tutorials have been made for this code, check them out at the following links.
